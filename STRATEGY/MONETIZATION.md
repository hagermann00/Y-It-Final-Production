### Disclosure Template
```
## Full Disclosure

This book contains affiliate links. When you click them and buy stuff, 
we get a commission. Unlike the gurus we mock, we're telling you upfront.

We only recommend products we'd actually use. If it's garbage, we won't 
link it even if they'd pay us. Our reputation matters more than a few 
bucks (barely, but still).
